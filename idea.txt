in this app i will create a page like a blog that have data from an external api
------ features ------ 
-(#1) selecting how many blog post you want to see. (DONE)
- ability to create a new blog post
- ability to update a blog post
- ability to Delete a blog post
- ability to search for a blog post
- ability to filter by author of the post 

todo tomorow :
i need to change (#1) cuz it overide the created posts i create, so I'm thinking
of making a new project that have all the features above with a real api,
but before that I need to complete this project, what remained is:
    - displaying comment of posts 
        hint: rounting with comment
